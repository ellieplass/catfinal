My goal was to make a cute, fun, intuitive desktop pet. I kept things simple to use, wanting to echo some of the feelings of a tamagotchi from my childhood. I want people to be able to enjoy it, especially those who may not have the time or space for a real pet cat. 


What are you making?
I have made an interactive digital pet cat.

Why are you making what you are making?
I wanted to make a companion for your desktop, something that you can play with and take care of during a long paper-writing session or desk job. I wanted it to be easy and not too complicated for the user, and to be something that required attention but not constant attention. 

Who are you making it for?
Anyone who spends a long amount of time on their computer, whether that be for work or for school. 

How should users feel while using it?
I want people to feel happy when using it, and to think that it’s cute! I hope it can be an appropriate distraction from stress that won’t distract anyone to the point of creating more stress. 

What do you want users to think about when interacting with it?
I want them to be able to take their mind off the projects they are working on or the stress of daily life, and just enjoy playing with the little cat for a while! So, I hope they are thinking about the cat. 

In what context will users interact with it?
Probably sitting at a desk or in bed on their computer.
